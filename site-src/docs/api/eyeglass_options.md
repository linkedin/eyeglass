title: eyeglass Options API
---

All node-sass options can be passed into eyeglass. Eyeglass-specfic options are:

## root

The directory from which the script runs. Changing this allows eyeglass to run from a directory other than the app root. Defaults to the current working directory.

## buildDir

Specifies where assets are installed to expose them according to their output url. Note that assets will not be installed if `buildDir` is not specified, unless you provide a custom installer.

## cacheDir

A cross-build cache directory for eyeglass modules to save files. For example, generated spritemaps from the [eyeglass spriting module](https://github.com/sass-eyeglass/eyeglass-spriting) are saved here. Defaults to a hidden directory called `.eyeglass-cache`.

## assetsHttpPrefix

A prefix to give assets for their output url.

## `ignoreDeprecations`

This option allows you to ignore deprecations. Set this to the version
of eyeglass for which deprecation warnings should be ignored. Any
deprecation warnings issues against that version or earlier will be
silenced. Any deprecation warnings for future releases will still be
output. Note: You can also set the environment variable
`EYEGLASS_DEPRECATIONS` to an eyeglass version on the console.

## `modules`

Eyeglass will traverse your dependency tree (`package.json`) to auto-load modules for you. If you have any modules that are not in your dependency tree, you can programmatically add them via the `modules` option.

This takes an array of `EyeglassModule`s to register. Each item should be one of the following signatures. Note that modules added programmatically cannot have dependencies.

### A manual module

```js
{
  name: "your-module-name",
  version: "0.0.1", // optional
  main: function(eyeglass, sass) {
    return {
      sassDir: path.join(__dirname, "sass"),
      functions: ..., // optional
      assets: ... // optional
    }
  }
}
```

### A module path

This should point to the path where a `package.json` for the module can be found.

```js
{
  path: path.join(__dirname, "bower_components/my-bower-module")
}
```
